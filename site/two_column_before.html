<h1>Two Column Design</h1>
<div>
	<p id="p1"> [SOUND] In this lecture we're going to talk about positioning elements by floating them. Now knowing how to properly float elements is an essential skill to have, and this is 
	partially because most of the UIs today, web UIs today 
	that are made, are made by floating the elements. 
	In fact, by the end of this lecture, we're going to create 
	a two column flexible design where the columns will be 
	flexible as we expand and contract the browser. 
	We styled the div tag, its background to be a certain color.
	</p>
	<p id="p2"> Basically a light bluish color, and every single paragraph 
	tag was styled to be 50 pixels wide and 50 pixels tall, 
	and we gave it a nice one pixel border. And just to differentiate
	between each paragraph box, we gave it a different background
	color to each one. So let's go ahead and take a look at what
	this looks like in the browser.
	</p>
	<section> This is regular content continuing after the paragraph boxes.
